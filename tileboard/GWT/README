Phase one of a GWT GUI for analysis of board positions. 
Please see the screenshot in this directory.

This GWT project currently supports 
  (a) database retrieval with continuous update, and 
  (b) dynamic layout and update of system status, and
  (c) GWT GUI with features
      i.   Load board
      ii.  Solve board
      iii. Select next move (mouseover and click)
      iv.  Select next tiles (mouseover and type)



In progress is interactive display of key statistics on 
benefit and potential risk for an combinatorial decision
making. This is demonstrated with the words and responses
for the Scrabble game.

This will enable forensic analysis of an opponent's position,
as well as picking the next move to make.

In particular, this will investigate the plausibility of a 
conspiratorial opponent. Such an opponent may be able to 
exploit extra information (i.e., "cheat") while playing 
chosen words that have both high probability of occurence, 
as well as a high score.


Within 0.25 seconds of the computer making a move, the user
is given a list of all user moves that can be made against 
the computer.  Placing the mouse over a word has the visual
result of updating the board, but not making the move itself.
Several seconds later there are extensive statistics on the
counter-moves which the computer may respond with. These are
shown in histogrammed form when the mouse moves over each
word.

The data is extensive, and the distribution is based on the
hypergeometric distribution which models without replacement.

Here is a partial data snapshot.  It should now be clear why
a GWT GUI is important to make good sense of this data.
